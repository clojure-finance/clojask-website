## Overview 
Clojask is an library for parallel computing datasets on Clojure

Our emphasis is on providing the following attributes
- Ease of installation and use 
- Efficient operations with low overhead 
- Provide ability to quickly process larger-than-memory datasets
- Utilise features of Clojure in the form of lazy sequences, macros, etc [link to the about page]
- Provide flexibility on single/cluster machine operations (Currently in the works)

## System of Operations
Clojask is defined by two key types: incremental and replaceable operations. 

### Replaceable operations 

Replaceable operatons include 
- set-type
- add-parser 
- group-by
- add-formatter

Replaceable operations can be called multiple times to **replace** the previous call of the operation 

```clojure 
(def x (dataframe "path/to/a.csv"))
;; defines dataframe from csv file "a.csv" 

(set-type x "int" "employee_no")
;; makes column "employee numbers" integers
 
(set-type x "str" "employee_no")
;; makes column "employee numbers" strings  
```

In the case above, Clojask will ultimately interpret the "employeee_no" column as a **string**, rather than an **integer**. 

### Incremental operations

Incremental operations include
- filter
- operate
- aggregate

Incremental operations are able to build on top of one another and build up **incrementally** in their operation.

```clojure
(filter x "Salary" (fn [salary] (<= salary 800)))
;; this statement deletes all the rows that have a salary larger than 800

(filter x "Department" (fn [dept] (= dept "computer science")))
;; this statements deletes all the rows that contain people not in the computer science department

(filter x ["Salary" "Department"] (fn [salary dept] (and (<= salary 800) (= dept "computer science"))))
;; keeps only people from computer science department with salary not larger than 800
```

This means additional incremental operations are appllied on top of exisiting operations
