## Dependencies

To make use of the functions in the Clojask library, it is important to ensure your dependencies are installed.

While using Clojask, the library will automatically set up the following dependencies. 

```clojure
  :dependencies [[clojure-csv "2.0.2"]
                 [org.clojure/clojure "1.10.1"]
                 [org.clojure/math.numeric-tower "0.0.4"]
                 ^{:voom {:repo "git@github.com:onyx-platform/onyx.git" :branch "master"}}
                 [org.onyxplatform/onyx "0.14.5"]
                 [techascent/tech.ml.dataset "5.17" :exclusions [[ch.qos.logback/logback-classic][org.slf4j/slf4j-api]]]
                 [com.google.code.externalsortinginjava/externalsortinginjava "0.6.0"]]
```

Please note that the above Onyx library is currently **only supported in Linux or MacOS.**
